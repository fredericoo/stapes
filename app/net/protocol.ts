/**
 * The wire between a browser and the game server.
 *
 * Two kinds of thing travel here, and keeping them apart is what makes the
 * protocol cheap:
 *
 * - **Cell patches** are the truth. The map is copy-on-write and chunked, so
 *   the server diffs one tick against the last broadcast by chunk identity and
 *   a step falls out as exactly the cells it touched — two, on a floor of
 *   thousands. Everyone is at the same map version, so it is one diff and one
 *   serialization per tick regardless of how many people are connected.
 * - **Motion events** are animation hints for things the map cannot express
 *   yet. A walk commits to the map only when it lands, so the server announces
 *   it at the start and the cell patch arrives 200ms later, exactly as the
 *   client's interpolation finishes. There is no position stream: a walking
 *   actor costs one event, not one message per tick.
 *
 * Both are the server talking about *other* people. A client draws its own
 * movement the instant it decides on it and tells the server afterwards, so for
 * the actor it owns these two are confirmation arriving late rather than news —
 * see {@link ClientMessage}'s `step`.
 *
 * Chat is the third kind and rides on its own message rather than inside a
 * patch, because it is the only thing here that is *not* for everybody. A
 * message goes to the sockets on the author's level and no further, so it cannot
 * share the one-serialization-for-all broadcast that makes patches cheap. Kept
 * apart, the patch path keeps that property untouched and chat pays its fan-out
 * only in the moment somebody talks.
 *
 * Everything inbound is parsed rather than cast — it arrives from a browser
 * nobody controls, and a malformed message must be a dropped message, not a
 * crashed world.

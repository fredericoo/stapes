# Agent notes — Stapes

## Map mutations must be undoable

Every change to map data (`MapFile` / placed tiles) **must** go through `useEditorStore.getState().commitMap(...)` (or a store method that calls it: `eraseAt`, `stampAt`, `stampMany`, `appendArmed`, `removeFromStack`, `reorderSelectedStack`, `setStackDirection`).

- Do **not** assign `map` via `setState`, mutate stacks in place, or call `mapData` helpers and write the result into the store yourself.
- Discrete edits (backspace/delete, stack panel trash/reorder/direction, tile picker append, shape stamp) use plain `commitMap(next)` so each gets its own undo entry.
- Paint drags use `beginStroke` → `commitMap(next, { coalesceInStroke: true })` → `endStroke` so the whole drag is one undo step.
- If you add a new map-editing path, wire it through `commitMap` and confirm ⌘Z undoes it before considering the work done.
